# AIGC-HWD: A Generative AI-Based Helmet Wearing Detection Dataset

## Overview
The AIGC-HWD (Artificial Intelligence Generated Content-Helmet Wearing Detection) dataset is designed to enhance the efficiency of safety helmet detection in the construction industry. It utilizes generative artificial intelligence to create a diverse set of image data that aids in the accurate detection of safety helmets, categorized by color. This contributes to improved identification and safety compliance on construction sites.

## Dataset Description
- **Total Images:** 1510
- **Categories:** Yellow, Red, White, Blue, None
- **Validation:** Tested with YOLOv8, Faster R-CNN, YOLOv11, and YOLOv11-MobileNetv4
- **Performance:** Models exhibit adaptability with a mean Average Precision (mAP) ranging from 0.7 to 0.8 in real-world scenarios, enhancing further when combined with real-world data.
